Using Selenium/Java Tool , maven and different framkeworks like testng and cucmber i have built my code to test nagwa website 
And i have used different design patterns like "POM" in writing my code as required 

i have worked on the steps required in the document form that was in the mail

I have used xpath and id locator.It's More Accurate
I have used different selenium commands to earn your trust
and finally in runner class is to ""create report after test"".


and i hope you find it useful.
Thanks.
